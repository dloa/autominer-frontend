# autominer-frontend
The autominer-frontend is a simple "Dashboard" style web application to display the status of your [`autominer-api`](https://github.com/oipwg/autominer-api) server. This is only the frontend that loads information from that backend. This portion of the application by itself will do nothing.

You can find a live version of this frontend at: [https://alexandria.io/autominer/](https://alexandria.io/autominer/)

## Usage
1. Install the `autominer-api` application by following the instructions on its [Github page (here)](https://github.com/oipwg/autominer-api#installation)
2. Navigate to where you have uploaded the `autominer-frontend` files, or go to the publicly hosted one at: https://alexandria.io/autominer/
3. Enter in your IP:Port and your API password and click connect.
